This is a 5-min introduction to AMD's University Program's
adaptive computing board, the AUP-ZU3 with no coding
or EDA tools needed!

## Objective

Let's get familiar with the terrain before we dive into harware or software design.
We will find the ports, identify the power source, and get to know some of the on-board
peripherals.

## Gear Check

* Aquire one <a href="https://www.realdigital.org/hardware/aup-zu3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                AUP-ZU3
             </a> board
  (either the 4 GB or 8 GB model)
* Other essentials:
    * Two USB-C cables
    * A FAT32 formated MicroSD card (at least 16GB)

1.  Power

    At first glance, you'll spot two USB-C ports. As per experience, in using simpler
    FPGA boards, one would assume that the one labled `PROG UART` is enough to power
    up the board, with `EXT PWR` as optional. Not here. Save yourself a day of
    head-scratching (ask me how I know T_T) and survey the [refernce manual](https://www.realdigital.org/hardware/aup-zu3)
    first. Leading to the correct port for power being `EXT PWR`, just to the right of
    the SD card socket.

    As for the power source â€” this board is picky. It will needs a USB-C adapter that delivers
    9V at 3A. Thatâ€™s at least 27W, so your random phone charger wonâ€™t cut it. The otional
    kit includes a suitable adapter, but I used a 30W unit that meets the spec just fine.

    Last step: flip the `USB PWR` switch to ON.

2.  Programming/Debugging
    Two main ways to talk to the board:
    *   Serial console â€” text-based window
    *   JTAG â€” via the `PROG UART` USB-C port

3.  SD memory card

    The MicroSD card can boot the board. The card can bounce between the ZU3's
    slot and your computer using a built-in reader or a USB adapter.

    Right below the `MICRO SD` slot lies the boot switch, use it to select either:
    * SD: ZU3 will automatically load the BOOT.BIN file, if card is properly formatted
    * JTAG: ZU3 will wait for commands over USB

<div class="content">

Before trekking out on our own, let's load an existing design
and survey some of the peripherals.

1.  Download one of the BOOT.BIN files below:
* <DownloadButton fileUrl={bootBin4gb} label="4GB BOOT.BIN" fileName="BOOT.bin" />
* <DownloadButton fileUrl={bootBin8gb} label="8GB BOOT.BIN" fileName="BOOT.bin" />

2.  Insert the MicroSD card into an SD reader on a computer. If itâ€™s not formatted,
    here are a couple of quick tutorials:
    * [Format to FAT32 Windows 10 or 11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRsjenGlsNo)
    * [Format FAT32 in Ubuntu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ_BcnZA0Z8)

3.  Once the card has been detected copy the BOOT.BIN file in the root of the card.

4.  Make sure the power switch on the board is off. Plug the USB-C cable with the adapter (power block)
    into the `EXT PWR` port. (I'm assuming you've plugged the adapter into a power source)

5.  Insert the MicroSD card, face side up, into the ZU3's `MICRO SD` slot. Since the `BOOT`
    switch is right under the slot, let's check to make sure it's flipped to `SD` boot mode
    (not `JTAG`).

6.  With the board still off, take the second USB-C cable and insert one end into a computer
    and the other end into the `PROG UART` port of the ZU3. New serial ports appear should
    pop up on your computer (a good sign that the board is alive).
    * In windows you can find this in Device Manager under the Ports tab as USB Serial Port
      COM8 (or another number)
    * On Linux, it will be something like "/dev/ttyUSB0" and "/dev/ttyUSB1"

    caption="Figure 3: AUP-ZU3 Board Connection Setup"
    width={400}
    />

7.  At this point you will need a terminal emulator application, there are many to choose from.
    For Windows I use either Putty or Tera Term, and for Linux you can use gtkterm. They are
    easy to use and simple to configure for the applications you might need them for.

    Once you have chosen the tool of your choice, configure the terminal for a serial port
    connection and UART. Set the port conection to serial port being used (COM8 on Windows
    or the second USB port on Linux), with UART configured with:
    * A baud rate/speed of 115,200
    * 8 bit words
    * 1 stop bit
    * No parity
    * No flow control

    We're keeping stuff minimal here. It should look something like this:
    ### In Tera Term

    <Figure
        src={teraConfig3}
        alt="Tera Term terminal connection window"
        caption="Figure 4: Tera Term Terminal Window: New Connection"
        width={300}
    />
    <Figure

        alt="Tera Term terminal window additional settings terminal tab"
        caption="Figure 5: Tera Term Terminal Window Terminal Configuration"
        width={300}
    />
    <Figure
        src={teraConfig2}
        alt="Tera Term terminal window additional settings serial port tab"
        caption="Figure 6: Tera Term Terminal Window Serial Port Configuration"
        width={300}
    />
    </div>
    * In the `New Connection` window choose the Serial option and select the port you are using
    * Click on `Setup` tab to get to the `Additional settings`
    * Once finished setting up click `OK`

    ### In Putty

    <div class="figure-row">
    <Figure
        src={puttyConfig1}
        alt="PuTTY session configuration"
        caption="Figure 7: PuTTY Session Configuration"
        width={350}
    />
    <Figure
        src={puttyConfig2}
        alt="PuTTY connection serial configuration"
        caption="Figure 8: PuTTY Serial Connection Configuration"
        width={350}
    />
    </div>

    * Once finished setting up the configuration click `Open`

8.  At last, the last step of our journey! Flip that switch on!
    * The power light should turn on (screen shot)
    * The "programmed" light should turn on after 2-3 second delay (this indicates the
      programmable logic was configured)
    * On the terminal window ... the welcome greeting should show up
    * Now just follow the instructions in the terminal window to interact with some of
      the features on the board
    * Feel free to flip the power switch off at any point to disconnect the board.
      Also, if you press the reset button (near the top of the board) it will just start
      the program over.

    Congrats, youâ€™ve officially powered up and met the AUP-ZU3.

## Lessons from the Field

In this exercise we got to experience using the AUP-ZU3 first hand. We went through how
to correctly set up and connect the board, open terminal window (will be especially useful
when debugging designs), and tested switches, buttons, white LEDs, and RGB LEDs (all from the PL side).
Hopefully these notes will help you save you from a few of the pitfalls I stumbled into. 

One last note: future entries won't rely on BOOT.BIN files and MicroSD cards to boot the board up. 
We'll the `JTAG` boot mode to directly program the board from the computer. If you really want to use
the MicroSD option then you can always build your own BOOT.BIN ðŸ˜….
