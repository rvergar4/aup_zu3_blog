This XYZ-min shows how to use the Vivado and Vitis tools
to create a hardware configuration and software application
for the ZYNQ Ultrascale+ MPSoC device.  This uses one ARM
core and one UART from the ZYNQ's Processing System block
and no programmable logic.

## Objective

This would be a very expensive way to implement a microcontroller
except that our true objective here is to (1) ensure that
necessary tools are installed correctly and functioning and
(2) begin to get experience with the many-step process of
going from a blank adaptive computing system chip to a
configured hardware/software running application.

## Pre-Requisites

*   Vivado and Vitis installed ... we like the description
    given by Digilent found here ...

*   an AUP-ZU3 board, two USB-C cables, and a power adapter
