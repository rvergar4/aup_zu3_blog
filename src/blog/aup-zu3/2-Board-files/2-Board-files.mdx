Sometimes the smallest step turns out to be the most necessary one. Before
Vivado can build anything for our board, it first needs to know the board
exists.

This very short "how to" shows how to install a "board file"
for Vivado, especially if it is not in the Xilinx Board Store.

Vivado already knows everything about AMD’s devices, the pins, timing, and
silicon details. What it doesn’t know is how those chips are connected once
they’re placed on a board. Many third-party vendors design custom PCBs with AMD
parts, and the only way for Vivado to understand those connections is through a
board file. The Vivado GUI includes a wizard that can install these files
temporarily, but it doesn’t make them available system-wide. And not every
third-party board (like the AUP-ZU3) is listed in the catalog. For those cases,
use the steps below.

## Objective

Before building designs or running software, we first need to make sure Vivado
knows about our board. In this short exercise, we’ll download and install the
AUP-ZU3 board files so Vivado can recognize the board by name when we create
new projects. Once that’s done, the board will appear in Vivado’s Board list,
ready for use in future projects.

## Pre-Requisites

* Vivado already installed (I'm using version 2024.2)
* Board file archive
* Basic familiarity with file paths or command-line tools

<summary>1. Download the Board Files</summary>
<div class="content">

For this example, we’ll be using the AUP-ZU3 board files. You can download
them by going to the <a href="https://www.realdigital.org/hardware/aup-zu3" 
                        target="_blank" 
                        rel="noopener noreferrer">
                        Real Digital
                     </a> site (in the Resources tab) or their <a href="https://github.com/RealDigitalOrg/aup-zu3-bsp/tree/master/board-files" 
                                                                  target="_blank" 
                                                                  rel="noopener noreferrer">
                                                                  Github repository
                                                                </a>.

After downloading, you should have a tar file named something like: 

`aup-zu3-board-files.tar`

Inside, you’ll see a directory containing `board.xml`, `preset.xml`, and other
related configuration files:

```
aup-zu3-board-files/
├── aup_zu3/1.0/
|   ├── board.xml
|   ├── part0_pins.xml
|   ├── preset.xml
|   └── xitem.json
└── aup-zu3-8gb/1.0/
```

<summary>2. Locate the Board Store</summary>
<div class="content">

After a bit of digging, and with help from an <a href="https://adaptivesupport.amd.com/s/article/The-board-file-location-with-the-latest-Vivado-tools?language=en_US" 
                                                 target="_blank" 
                                                 rel="noopener noreferrer">
                                                 AMD support article
                                              </a>,
I found where Vivado keeps its board store tucked away. According to this article Vivado
2021.2 and newer store board files here:

```
<Vivado Install>\<Vivado_version>\data\xhub\boards\XilinxBoardStore\boards\Xilinx\
```

On my Windows system with Vivado 2024.2:

```
C:\Xilinx\Vivado\2024.2\data\xhub\boards\XilinxBoardStore\boards\Xilinx\
```

On Linux:
```
/opt/Xilinx/Vivado/<version>/data/boards/XilinxBoardStore/boards/Xilinx/
```

Replace `<version>` with the Vivado release you’re using (for example, `2024.2`)

*(Note: Older versions' board file location is*

`<VivadoInstall>\<Vivado_version>\data/boards\board_files\`)

</div>

<details>
<summary>3. Copy the Files</summary>
<div class="content">

Once you know where the board store lives, copy the downloaded files into it.
I extracted the board files into the folder located above.

<div class="figure-row">
<Figure
    src={extractTo}
    alt="Extract archive window"
    caption="Figure 1: Unpacking the AUP-ZU3 board files"
    width={300}
/>
<Figure
    src={extractedFiles}
    alt="File explorer window showing extracted board files"
    caption="Figure 2: Extracted Board Files"
    width={400}
/>
</div>

Or, unzip the archive and drop the folders right into said Xilinx directory.

Example:

Windows CMD:
```cmd
xcopy "C:\Users\<UserName>\Downloads\aup-zu3-board-files" "C:\Xilinx\Vivado\2024.2\data\xhub\boards\XilinxBoardStore\boards\Xilinx\aup-zu3-board-files\" /E /I
```

Or in Linux:
```bash
sudo cp -r /home/<UserName>/Downloads/aup-zu3-board-files /opt/Xilinx/Vivado/2024.2/data/boards/XilinxBoardStore/boards/Xilinx/
```

</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>4. Verify Installation</summary>
<div class="content">

Time for a quick check:

1. Launch Vivado and start a new project:
2. Choose Boards instead of Parts
3. The AUP-ZU3 board should now appear in the list

<Figure
  src={selectBoard}
  alt="New Project window selecting part section"
  caption="Figure 3: The AUP-ZU3 now appears in Vivado’s board list — installation complete"
/>

If it doesn’t:
* Make sure the folder structure is correct
* Confirm you placed the files in a `boards/Xilinx` subdirectory
* Restart Vivado and check again

</div>
</details>

## Field Summary

A short detour, but a necessary one. With the board files in place, Vivado is
now board-aware, ready to set pins, presets, and interfaces automatically.

Next time you start a new project, the AUP-ZU3 will be there waiting in the
list, a small but satisfying victory on the embedded frontier.
