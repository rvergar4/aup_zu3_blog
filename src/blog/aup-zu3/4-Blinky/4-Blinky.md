  The embedded programmer's equivalent to "Hello, World!" is Blinky ... here add some switches and LEDs to our basic microcontroller design and you can make manually make the LED blink if that\'s your thing. :-)

This XYZ-min shows how to use the vendor-provided board
files to quickly add some peripherals to the Zynq's processing
system block to extend the functionality of the adaptive
computing system.

## Objective

The goal is to use Vivado to add more than just one Processing
System block to our custom computing system.  After doing that,
it will force us to consider the software aspects and will give
you exposure to the very "standalone" run-time system and how
it is generated based on the hardware we implement in the programmable
logic.

## Pre-Requisites

*   Vivado and Vitis installed ... we like the description
    given by Digilent found here ...

*   an AUP-ZU3 board, two USB-C cables, and a power adapter

*   basics of memory-mapped I/O from an embedded systems course
